Idea

To write Newlisp code as if you were writing HTML.

To achieve this every HTML5 tag should have it's counterpart function.

Every function accepts two string parameters: first one goes inside tag, as in 

<input type="text">

and the second one goes between opening and closing tag, as in

<p>This goes between</p>

Further parameters are concatenated to second one.

Every function returns a string with the computed html code.
