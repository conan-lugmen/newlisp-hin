- the html-tag functions created by the hin macro accepts only a couple of
  parameters, first one is the inner code, second one is the content between
  tags. The rest are ignored, so this code:

(html "something inside" ; -> first parameter
	(head ""
		(title "class=mango" "the title")) ; second parameter to html (the full head returned string)
	(body "..." "...")) ; -> it doesn't matter, from here onwards all is IGNORED
