- make function auto quote innerTag values everytime it finds an equal sign, to
  avoid having to call like this:

(html "lang=\"en\"")

and be able to call it simpler, like this:

(html "lang=en")

- as is written now, the code isn't appropriate to define snippets of code.
  Because each tag opens and closes inside the function. There're two possible
  solutions:

	- to make the functions accept optional parameters defining the 3 possible
	  actions: open tag, close tag, open and close tag

	- to create another pair of functions for opening and closing a tag along
	  with the creation of the one which opens and close

Also I have to consider not every tag is used in split way, html, head, body
are perhaps the most used split since they define large chunks of code, but the
rest of the tags will be opened and closed in the same context most of the
time. So is it necessary to create the full set of 3 functions (open, close,
open and close) for each tag? Maybe I should go with the parametrized version.

- Maybe I can simplify macro, right now I'm maintaining two possible returns, I
  should move the 'if' that fixes the symbol issue inside and make only one
  definition.
